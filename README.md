# AWS Athena Analytical Queries

This repository contains five SQL analytical queries executed on Amazon Athena for the `raw/output_db` dataset.  
The project analyzes sales performance, product trends, and growth patterns using AWS Athena, S3, IAM roles, and CloudWatch.

## üß© Queries Overview

| Query No. | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **1** | Cumulative Sales Over Time for a Specific Year |
| **2** | Geographic Hotspot Analysis (Top or Problematic States) |
| **3** | Impact of Discounts/Promotions on Profitability |
| **4** | Top 3 Most Profitable Products Within Each Category |
| **5** | Monthly Sales and Profit Growth Analysis |

Each query is stored as a separate `.sql` file under the `/queries` directory, and corresponding CSV outputs are in `/results`.

### Query 1 

SELECT
    order_date,
    daily_sales,
    SUM(daily_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_sales
FROM (
    SELECT
        date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y') AS order_date,
        SUM("Amount") AS daily_sales
    FROM output_db.raw
    WHERE date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y') BETWEEN DATE '2022-01-01' AND DATE '2022-12-31'
    GROUP BY date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y')
) t
ORDER BY order_date
LIMIT 10;

## ‚öôÔ∏è AWS Components Used
- **S3 Bucket:** Stores the raw dataset and Athena query results.  
- **IAM Role:** Grants Athena permissions to access S3.  
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors query performance and execution logs.

## üß† Approach Summary
1. Connected Athena to **AwsDataCatalog ‚Üí output_db ‚Üí raw** table.  
2. Verified schema using `DESCRIBE output_db.raw;`  
3. Wrote 5 analytical queries using window functions, aggregation, and date parsing.  
4. Exported each result as CSV using the Athena console.  
5. Uploaded queries, results, and screenshots to GitHub.
